## Before you start

- Processors (dyeing/printing mills) must be created in Suppliers with processor type
- Greige fabrics must exist in Greige Master for fabric rate cards
- Greige laces must exist in Lace Master for lace rate cards

## How to access

Sidebar: Materials & Masters > Configuration > Processor Rate Cards

## Understanding the system

Rate cards define what a processor charges per meter for dyeing or printing fabric/lace. Rates vary by:
- **Material type**: Fabric or Lace
- **Processing type**: Dyeing or Printing (fabric only)
- **Printing sub-type**: Pigment, Procian, Discharge, or Pigment Discharge
- **Greige/Lace**: Each base material can have different rates
- **Quantity slabs**: Larger orders often get better rates

## Steps to create a rate card

### Step 1: Select material type

At the top, choose between:
- **Fabric** - for greige fabric processing rates
- **Lace** - for greige lace dyeing rates (lace only supports dyeing)

### Step 2: Select processing type (fabric only)

For fabric, choose:
- **Dyeing** - solid colour processing
- **Printing** - then select sub-type: Pigment, Procian, Discharge, or Pigment Discharge

### Step 3: Select processor

Click the **Select Processor** box and type part of the processor's (mill's) name or code, then pick it. The summary dashboard shows all processors with their configuration status:
- **Complete** - fully configured with rates
- **Partial** - some rates configured
- **Not Configured** - no rates set

### Step 4: Add quantity slabs

Slabs define price tiers based on order quantity (in meters).

1. Click "Add Slab" button in the table header
2. Enter min and max quantity (e.g., 0-500m, 500-2000m)
3. Click the checkmark to save the slab range

**Important**: Slabs auto-sort by min quantity. Rates are per meter within each range.

### Step 5: Add material rows

Click "Add Greige Row" (or "Add Lace Row" for lace mode):
1. Search for greige fabrics/laces in the popup
2. Select multiple items using checkboxes
3. Click "Add X Greige(s)" to add selected rows

### Step 6: Enter rates

For each greige/lace row:
1. Enter shrinkage percentage (fabric only) - used in costing calculations
2. Enter rate per meter for each quantity slab

Click "Save Changes" to persist all entries.

**You do not have to fill every slab.** A quantity bigger than a row's last filled slab is charged at that last slab's rate. Example: rates filled up to the 1000-1500m slab and nothing after it — a 2000 m or 4000 m job still gets the 1000-1500m rate. The empty cells after a row's last rate show that rate in grey ("uses 10"); hover a cell to see which slab it comes from.

## Working with rate cards

### Copy rates between processors

1. Configure rates for one processor
2. Click "Copy to Another Processor"
3. In **Target Processor**, click the box and type part of the processor's name or code to pick it
4. Optionally check "Copy rates" (slabs always copy)
5. Click "Copy Structure"

This is useful when multiple processors have similar rates.

### Copy row data

To quickly apply the same rates to multiple greiges:
1. Click the clipboard icon on a configured row to copy
2. Click paste icon on other rows to apply same shrinkage + rates
3. Or click "Paste to New Greige" to add new rows with copied rates

### Default rates mode

Click "Default Rates" button to configure system-wide fallback rates:
- These rates apply when no processor is specified in Fabric Costing
- Useful for initial costing estimates before processor selection

### Edit slabs

Click on a slab header (e.g., "0-500m") to edit the range:
1. Modify min and max quantities
2. Click checkmark to confirm
3. Slabs auto-reorder based on min quantity

### Remove items

- **Remove slab**: Hover over slab header, click X (deletes rates for all materials in that slab)
- **Remove greige/lace row**: Click trash icon in Actions column

## Understanding the summary dashboard

When no processor is selected, the dashboard shows:
- **Stats cards**: Total processors, configured, complete, total greiges
- **Processor cards**: Click any to configure
- **Coverage bar**: Percentage of matrix filled with rates
- **Rate range**: Min and max rates configured

Filter and sort options:
- Search by processor name/code
- Filter by status (All, Complete, Partial, Not Configured)
- Sort by name, status, or coverage percentage

## Traps

- **Last rate carries up, never down**: An empty slab AFTER a row's last rate uses that rate. An empty slab BEFORE a row's first rate stays unpriced — a 400 m job on a row filled only from 1000m up gets no rate, and Fabric Costing says which slab to fill
- **Save before switching**: Unsaved changes block switching material type, processing type, or processor
- **Slab deletion warning**: Deleting a slab removes ALL rates for that quantity range
- **Shrinkage is per-processor**: Each processor can have different shrinkage for the same greige
- **Default shrinkage**: If not set, the greige master's average shrinkage is used as placeholder
- **Lace is dyeing only**: Lace rate cards only support dyeing (no printing option)
